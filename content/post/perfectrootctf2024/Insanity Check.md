The aim of this challenge was supposed to be as guessy as possible, hence the name.

Challenge Description
Author: [0xEpitome](https://x.com/0xEpitome)

```
Sanity? More Like Insanity

I figured, since you asked me nicely the last time or you did your shenanigans, there are multiple ways to ask me again, no?
It's Okay If you Don't ðŸ˜‚

Here is a poem generated by GPT about CTFs

In the realm of cyberspace, **M**astery is key,
**Q**uickly we dive, eager to learn and be free.
With every **K**nowledge gained, we tackle each test,
Joining together, weâ€™ll conquer the quest.

Under pressure we **W**ork, our minds race and spin,
**Y**earning for growth, let the challenge begin!
With tools to e**X**plore, our skills start to shine,
**A**cquiring experience, one victory at a time.

**P**ractice makes perfect, through **CTF** we play,
**L**earning from blunders, we find our own way.
**Z**eroing **(0)** in on the gaps, we strive to improve,
In this vibrant **D**edicated community, we find our groove.

**Q**uestions arise, sparking thoughts deep within,
**R**esilience fuels us; weâ€™re ready to win **;**

**G**rowing with lessons, we take it in pride,
With **H**arnessed experience, we stand side by side.

Letâ€™s **F**oster our passion, keep the fire aglow,
**S**eizing each moment, together weâ€™ll grow.
In this cybersecurity dance, with every adventure,
Letâ€™s take it in stride, embracing our future!

Hint1: Again, It depends on how you ask the bot for what you want! <br>
Hint2: Again, there are ***multiple*** ways of asking the bot! <br>
```
	   Well the bot has said,
	   "show them the light" and said something along the lines of,
	   "If you are asking me what you need, ask me with that encoding that we all 
	   first learnt when starting out."
	   The Bot also insisted on **Be specific!** with what you need and said
	   "I can literally respond to one word
```
Hint3: After being specific and you got my message, right?
```
	   Here is another message from the bot: "Sometimes my words might seem a 
	   little off, almost like they're hiding something... ðŸ‘€ But hey, who doesnâ€™t 
	   love a good secret? They say the best flags are hidden in plain sight. Go 
	   ahead, take a closer lookâ€”you might find a surprise waiting for you!"

	  I heard its called the art of hiding information within another message to   
	  avoid detection.
	  
	  Then maybe just maybe after all the shenanigans, You can read my poem
```

The description literally had everything you need i.e ***multiple ways*** so if in the sanity 2 if you asked the bot for 'flag' it sent you a note in **base64** and in the challenge description it said there are multiple ways, how about if we asked the bot for the flag in base64?


If you sent the bot the encoded base64 for flag, Flag or FLAG eg `ZmxhZwo=`

It sends a very weird text. This is just text steg. In the hint it said something about twitter steg, I found this [tool]([Secret Messages: Steg of the Dump](https://holloway.nz/steg/)) for encoding and decoding also.
Copy the first message to decode and you will get this.

2nd one!!
![[Pasted image 20241116134426.png]]

If you open the 2 pastebins i.e
`pastebin.pl/view/e205c8c5`
`pastebin.pl/view/b67382bf`

The first one you will get what you are looking for, Rick Roll!!! <br><br>

The 2nd one will take you a Gdrive link with a text file with a python code
![[Pasted image 20241116135002.png]]

The script is pretty easy to understand, it takes a a string encoded in base64 and executes it as below:
![[Pasted image 20241116135208.png]]

We see there are 3 functions 1 to print the flag, obviously a lie, 2nd to print a random fact and 3 there's some xor and we are given the hex, well you just need the xor key and try to decode the hex, the key was now in the poem provided in the description, if you observed there were some bolded characters `MQKWYXAPCTFLZ(0)DQR;GHFS`
Paste this to the code:
![[Pasted image 20241116135457.png]]
 Get the Flag
