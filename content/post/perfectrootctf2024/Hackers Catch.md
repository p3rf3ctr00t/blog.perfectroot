The 2 challenges were game rev challenges which their aim was to test the use of the basics of [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/)

When we run the  game:

We can see a little description that hinted the game was being timed, in this case I made it 10 seconds, so we had 10 seconds to reach a score of 100/100 in order to get the "reward". 
This is pretty straightforward. Open cheat engine and attach the process to cheat engine.

We can enable speedhack and set it to 0 so in laymans terms the game is slowed down, and now we can chase the ball at our own pace with no restriction of time.
